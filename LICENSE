*     3a. In order to be referred to as "BabelStream benchmark results",
*         published results must be in conformance to the BabelStream
*         Run Rules incorporated herein by reference.
*         The copyright holders retain the
*         right to determine conformity with the Run Rules.
*     3b. Results based on modified source code or on runs not in
*         accordance with the BabelStream Run Rules must be clearly
*         labelled whenever they are published.  Examples of
*         proper labelling include:
*         "tuned BabelStream benchmark results"
*         "based on a variant of the BabelStream benchmark code"
*         Other comparable, clear and reasonable labelling is
*         acceptable.
*     3c. Submission of results to the BabelStream benchmark web site
*         is encouraged, but not required.

* Run Rules:
*
* In order to generate a valid BabelStream result measuring
* *main memory bandwidth*, you should obey the following rules:
*
* 1. The array size must be large enough that increasing the array size does not
* drastically change the reported bandwidth. If you satisfy this you will no
* longer be affected by any cache effects.
*
* 2. Each kernel should take a few milliseconds. The resolution of the host timer
* is probably in milliseconds so each kernel execution should be longer than the
* timer resolution. Increase the array size if the kernels are too fast. You are
* unlikely to break this rule if you follow rule 1.
*
* If you see a single BabelStream result, expect this to be the largest bandwidth
* reported by the benchmark unless stated otherwise.
